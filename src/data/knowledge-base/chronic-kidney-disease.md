# About chronic kidney disease (CKD)
Your kidneys do many important jobs. Some of the ways they keep your whole body in balance include:

* Removing natural waste products and extra water from your body
* Helping make red blood cells
* Balancing important minerals in your body
* Helping maintain your blood pressure
* Keeping your bones healthy
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is when the kidneys have become damaged over time (for at least 3 months) and have a hard time doing all their important jobs. CKD also increases the risk of other health problems like heart disease and stroke. Developing CKD is usually a very slow process with very few symptoms at first. So, CKD is divided into 5 stages to help guide treatment decisions.

## Signs and symptoms
Many people living with CKD do not have any symptoms until the more advanced stages and/or complications develop. If symptoms do happen, they may include:

* Foamy urine
* Urinating (peeing) more often or less often than usual
* Itchy and/or dry skin
* Feeling tired
* Nausea
* Loss of appetite
* Weight loss without trying to lose weight
People who have more advanced stages of CKD may also notice:

* Trouble concentrating
* Numbness or swelling in your arms, legs, ankles, or feet
* Achy muscles or cramping
* Shortness of breath
* Vomiting
* Trouble sleeping
* Breath smells like ammonia
