# Understanding the Stages of CKD
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) signifies a gradual loss of kidney function over time. Your kidneys are vital for filtering waste, managing blood pressure, and maintaining overall balance in your body. Understanding the stage of your CKD is key to determining the right treatment plan.

Being diagnosed with a kidney condition can be a scary time. Find out about treatments across the five stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD).

## How CKD is Evaluated
Kidney health is primarily assessed through two simple tests: the estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR), which is a blood test, and the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACR), a urine test. Both are essential for a complete understanding of your kidney function. To confirm a CKD diagnosis, these tests are typically repeated over three months to verify long-term damage. An eGFR below 60 or a uACR above 30 for three months or more can indicate kidney disease.

## The 5 Stages of CKD
### Stage 1 CKD
Kidney damage present but function is near normal.
- **eGFR:** 90 or higher
- **uACR:** 30+

### Stage 2 CKD
Mild loss of kidney function.
- **eGFR:** 60-89
- **uACR:** 30+

### Stage 3a CKD
Mild to moderate loss of kidney function.
- **eGFR:** 45-59

### Stage 3b CKD
Moderate to severe loss of kidney function.
- **eGFR:** 30-44

### Stage 4 CKD
Severe loss of kidney function.
- **eGFR:** 15-29

### Stage 5 CKD
Kidney failure, requiring dialysis or transplant.
- **eGFR:** less than 15

## Risk Factors for CKD
Anyone can develop CKD, but certain factors increase your risk. Often, it's a combination of physical, environmental, and social factors. Knowing the risks is the first step toward early detection, as CKD often has no early symptoms.

- Diabetes
- High Blood Pressure (Hypertension)
- Heart Disease and/or Heart Failure
- Obesity (BMI of 30 or more)
- Over Age 60
- Family History of CKD or kidney failure
- Acute Kidney Injury (Personal history of AKI)
- Smoking and/or tobacco use
