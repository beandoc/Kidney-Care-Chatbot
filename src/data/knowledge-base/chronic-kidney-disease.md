# Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)

## What is Chronic Kidney Disease?

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) means your kidneys are damaged and can't filter blood the way they should. This damage happens slowly over a long period of time. The disease is called "chronic" because the damage to your kidneys is long-term and usually doesn't get better. As CKD gets worse, wastes can build to high levels in your blood and make you feel sick. You may develop complications like high blood pressure, anemia (low blood count), weak bones, poor nutritional health, and nerve damage.

## Stages of CKD

CKD has five stages, from very mild damage in stage 1 to complete kidney failure in stage 5. The stages are based on the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which is a measure of how well your kidneys are working.

-   **Stage 1 (GFR 90 or higher):** Mild kidney damage. Your kidneys are still working well, but you may have signs of damage, such as protein in your urine.
-   **Stage 2 (GFR 60-89):** Mild loss of kidney function.
-   **Stage 3a (GFR 45-59):** Mild to moderate loss of kidney function.
-   **Stage 3b (GFR 30-44):** Moderate to severe loss of kidney function.
-   **Stage 4 (GFR 15-29):** Severe loss of kidney function. At this stage, you will likely need to start preparing for dialysis or a kidney transplant.
-   **Stage 5 (GFR less than 15):** Kidney failure (also called end-stage renal disease, or ESRD). Your kidneys have lost nearly all their ability to function. You will need dialysis or a kidney transplant to live.

## Symptoms of CKD

In the early stages of CKD, you may not have any symptoms. Many people don't realize they have a problem until their kidney function is very low. As the disease progresses, symptoms can include:

-   Feeling more tired and having less energy
-   Trouble concentrating
-   Poor appetite
-   Trouble sleeping
-   Muscle cramping at night
-   Swollen feet and ankles
-   Puffiness around your eyes, especially in the morning
-   Dry, itchy skin
-   Needing to urinate more often, especially at night

## How is CKD Managed?

The goals of treatment are to slow down the progression of kidney disease and manage complications. Treatment includes:

-   **Controlling Blood Pressure:** This is the most important step. ACE inhibitors and ARBs are common blood pressure medications that also protect the kidneys.
-   **Managing Blood Sugar:** For people with diabetes, keeping blood sugar levels in a target range is crucial.
-   **A Kidney-Friendly Diet:** You may need to limit sodium, protein, phosphorus, and potassium in your diet. A dietitian can help you create a meal plan.
-   **Medications:** You may need medicines to manage complications like anemia or high cholesterol.
-   **Avoiding Certain Medications:** Some over-the-counter pain relievers (like NSAIDs) can be harmful to your kidneys. Always talk to your doctor before taking any new medication.

By managing CKD with lifestyle changes and medication, you can help slow down the damage to your kidneys and maintain your quality of life.
