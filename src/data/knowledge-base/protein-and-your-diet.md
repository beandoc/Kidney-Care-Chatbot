# Protein and Your CKD Diet
Understanding how much protein to eat is vital for managing kidney disease. Your needs change depending on your stage of CKD and whether you are on dialysis.

## Why Protein Matters
Everyone needs protein to build muscle, repair tissue, and fight infection. Protein comes from both animal sources (meat, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy) and plant sources (beans, nuts, lentils, grains). However, when your body uses protein, it creates waste products that your kidneys must filter. If you have kidney disease, this process can put extra strain on your kidneys.

Too much protein can cause waste to build up in your blood, leading to nausea, weakness, and loss of appetite. Too little can cause muscle loss and weakness. Finding the right balance is key.

## CKD Without Dialysis: Limit Protein
If you have CKD but are not on dialysis, your doctor will likely recommend a lower-protein diet. This is because reducing the amount of protein waste can ease the burden on your kidneys and may even help slow the progression of kidney disease. Many studies suggest that focusing on plant-based proteins, which produce less acid waste, can be particularly beneficial.

## On Dialysis: Increase Protein
Once you begin dialysis, your protein needs increase. The dialysis process itself removes protein from your blood, so you need to eat more to replace what is lost and maintain your strength and health. A low-protein diet is no longer necessary, and your dietitian will guide you on how to incorporate more high-quality protein into your meals.

## Finding Your Right Amount
The exact amount of protein you need is personalized. It depends on your body size, stage of kidney disease, and overall health. It is never a good idea to guess. The best way to know your specific protein needs is to work with a kidney dietitian.

## Consult a Kidney Dietitian
A kidney dietitian is an expert in creating eating plans for people with CKD. They can analyze your lab results and lifestyle to determine the right amount and type of protein for you, even in the very early stages of the disease. Ask your doctor for a referral to ensure you're on the right track with your nutrition.
