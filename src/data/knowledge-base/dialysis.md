# Dialysis

## What is haemodialysis?
Haemodialysis is a treatment for kidney failure. When your kidneys don’t work properly, they can’t clean your blood, so toxins build up in your bloodstream.

Your kidneys also make less urine so excess fluid and waste products remain in the body. Haemodialysis ‘cleans’ your blood by running it through a dialysis machine filter to remove toxins and excess fluid. The clean blood is then returned to your body and the dialysis fluid is thrown away.

## How can haemodialysis help me?
Haemodialysis can help relieve symptoms related to kidney failure, including feeling sick, tired or weak.

It can also help with symptoms caused by having too much fluid in your body, such as puffy ankles and shortness of breath. Haemodialysis can also help to protect your bones and reduce your potassium levels.

### Preparation and Support

#### What needs to happen before I can start haemodialysis?
During haemodialysis your blood is taken from your body and cleaned in a dialysis machine. For most people, access to your bloodstream is through a special connection in your arm called an arterio-venous (AV) fistula. This is made by a small medical procedure that joins two types of blood vessels: an artery, which carries blood from the heart round the body, and a vein, which carries blood back to the heart. This makes one large, stronger blood vessel.

If your blood vessels are very small or fragile, a piece of tubing called an arterio-venous graft may be used instead of a fistula. A fistula needs to be made about six to eight weeks before dialysis starts, to allow time for it to ‘mature’ and get strong enough.

If you need dialysis before your fistula or graft is ready or you are unable to have one made, then you can have haemodialysis through a special dialysis line in your neck (central venous line). This can be used immediately.

You will also be advised to have a vaccine to protect you from hepatitis B. This is a virus that can be caught from blood. The vaccine may be given by the dialysis team or by your GP.

#### Who will help me with my treatment?
In hospital, a dialysis nurse or healthcare assistant will help you with your haemodialysis. You will also be seen regularly by a doctor who will advise on your medications and monitor your blood test results. A kidney dietitian will check whether you need to make any changes to your diet, such as limiting the amount of salt, potassium or phosphate that you eat. They will help with practical suggestions about how to adapt your diet.

Some people learn to do some or all of their haemodialysis themselves, with guidance and support from nursing staff. Your kidney team can provide more information on shared haemodialysis care.

#### What support is available to help manage my dialysis?
Starting haemodialysis is a big change. It will impact your everyday life and routines, including work, social life and relationships. Your kidney team are there to help you and your family. You may also find it useful to talk to a renal social worker or counsellor, who can help you with a range of practical and emotional matters.

## Types of Dialysis

There are two main types of dialysis: hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.

### 1. Hemodialysis (HD)

In hemodialysis, an artificial kidney (called a hemodialyzer) is used to remove waste and extra chemicals and fluid from your blood.

-   **How it works:** To get your blood into the dialyzer, a doctor needs to make an access, or entrance, into your blood vessels. This is done with minor surgery, usually to your arm. The two types of access are an arteriovenous (AV) fistula and an AV graft.
-   **Where it's done:** Hemodialysis can be done in a hospital, a dialysis center, or at home.
-   **Schedule:** Most patients go to a center three times per week for about 3 to 4 hours per session. Home hemodialysis schedules may be more frequent (e.g., 4-7 times per week) for shorter hours each time.

### 2. Peritoneal Dialysis (PD)

In peritoneal dialysis, your blood is cleaned inside your body.

-   **How it works:** A doctor will place a soft plastic tube (catheter) into your abdomen (belly) with surgery. During the treatment, a sterile cleansing fluid called dialysate is put into your belly through the catheter. After the filtering process is finished, the fluid leaves your body through the catheter.
-   **Where it's done:** PD is usually done at home, and can even be done while you sleep.
-   **Types of PD:**
    -   **Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD):** This is "manual" dialysis. You do the exchanges yourself, usually four or five times a day. You can be up and about while the dialysate is in your abdomen.
    -   **Automated Peritoneal Dialysis (APD):** This type of PD uses a machine called a cycler to do the exchanges for you, typically at night while you sleep.
