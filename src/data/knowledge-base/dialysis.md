# Dialysis

## What is Dialysis?

Dialysis is a treatment that takes over the function of your kidneys when they stop working properly. It is a way of cleaning your blood to remove waste products, extra salt, and water, and to help control your blood pressure. Dialysis is a life-saving treatment for people with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), or kidney failure.

## When is Dialysis Needed?

You need dialysis when you develop end-stage kidney failure, which is usually when you have lost about 85 to 90 percent of your kidney function and have a GFR of less than 15. At this point, your kidneys are no longer able to remove enough waste and fluid from your blood to keep you healthy.

## Types of Dialysis

There are two main types of dialysis: hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.

### 1. Hemodialysis (HD)

In hemodialysis, an artificial kidney (called a hemodialyzer) is used to remove waste and extra chemicals and fluid from your blood.

-   **How it works:** To get your blood into the dialyzer, a doctor needs to make an access, or entrance, into your blood vessels. This is done with minor surgery, usually to your arm. The two types of access are an arteriovenous (AV) fistula and an AV graft.
-   **Where it's done:** Hemodialysis can be done in a hospital, a dialysis center, or at home.
-   **Schedule:** Most patients go to a center three times per week for about 3 to 4 hours per session. Home hemodialysis schedules may be more frequent (e.g., 4-7 times per week) for shorter hours each time.

### 2. Peritoneal Dialysis (PD)

In peritoneal dialysis, your blood is cleaned inside your body.

-   **How it works:** A doctor will place a soft plastic tube (catheter) into your abdomen (belly) with surgery. During the treatment, a sterile cleansing fluid called dialysate is put into your belly through the catheter. After the filtering process is finished, the fluid leaves your body through the catheter.
-   **Where it's done:** PD is usually done at home, and can even be done while you sleep.
-   **Types of PD:**
    -   **Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD):** This is "manual" dialysis. You do the exchanges yourself, usually four or five times a day. You can be up and about while the dialysate is in your abdomen.
    -   **Automated Peritoneal Dialysis (APD):** This type of PD uses a machine called a cycler to do the exchanges for you, typically at night while you sleep.

## Choosing a Treatment

The right type of dialysis for you depends on your medical condition, lifestyle, and personal preference. Your doctor and healthcare team will discuss the pros and cons of each option with you to help you make the best choice for your life. Both types of dialysis are effective at cleaning the blood.
