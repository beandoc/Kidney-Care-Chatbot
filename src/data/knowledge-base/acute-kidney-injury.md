# Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)

## What is Acute Kidney Injury?

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a sudden episode of kidney failure or kidney damage that happens within a few hours or a few days. AKI causes a build-up of waste products in your blood and makes it hard for your kidneys to keep the right balance of fluid in your body. It is common in patients who are already in the hospital, particularly in intensive care units.

## Symptoms of AKI

The symptoms of AKI can include:

-   Decreased urine output (peeing very little)
-   Swelling in the legs, ankles, or around the eyes due to fluid retention
-   Fatigue and tiredness
-   Shortness of breath
-   Confusion or mental fogginess
-   Nausea and vomiting
-   In severe cases, seizures or coma
-   Chest pain or pressure

Sometimes, AKI has no symptoms and is only found through lab tests.

## What causes AKI?

There are three main types of causes for AKI:

1.  **Decreased Blood Flow to the Kidneys:**
    -   Sudden, serious blood loss or dehydration
    -   Heart attack or heart failure, leading to low blood pressure
    -   Infection (sepsis)
    -   Liver failure
    -   Use of certain medications like blood pressure drugs, NSAIDs (like ibuprofen), or others that can affect blood flow.

2.  **Direct Damage to the Kidneys:**
    -   Sepsis (severe infection)
    -   Certain medications, toxins, or contrast dyes used in imaging tests
    -   Inflammation of the small filters in the kidneys (glomerulonephritis)
    -   Blood clots in or around the kidneys

3.  **Blockage of the Urinary Tract:**
    -   Enlarged prostate
    -   Kidney stones
    -   A tumor in the bladder or nearby areas
    -   Nerve damage affecting the bladder

## How is AKI treated?

Treatment for AKI usually requires a hospital stay and focuses on addressing the underlying cause. The goal is to help your kidneys recover and prevent further damage. Treatment may include:

-   **Balancing Fluids:** You may receive IV fluids to treat dehydration or be given diuretics (water pills) to help your body get rid of excess fluid.
-   **Medications:** Your doctor may adjust your current medications or prescribe new ones to control blood potassium and restore the balance of other minerals.
-   **Dialysis:** If waste products build up to dangerous levels in your blood, you may need temporary dialysis (hemodialysis) to filter your blood until your kidneys recover.

With proper and timely treatment, AKI can often be reversed.
