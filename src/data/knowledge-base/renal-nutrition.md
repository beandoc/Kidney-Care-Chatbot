# Your Guide to Renal Nutrition
Making healthy food choices is vital for everyone, especially if you have chronic kidney disease (CKD). Good nutrition can help slow the progression of CKD, provide energy, and maintain overall health.

## The Role of a Registered Dietitian
A registered dietitian specializing in kidney disease can be an invaluable partner. They can create a personalized eating plan based on your lifestyle and lab results, help you manage related conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure, and guide you in slowing the progression of your kidney disease. Ask your doctor for a referral; this service is often covered by Medicare and other insurance plans.

## Key Nutrients to Manage in CKD
Eating a well-balanced diet helps manage CKD better. People with CKD may need to control their intake of certain nutrients to avoid buildup in the blood. Your dietitian or healthcare provider will guide you based on your specific needs and lab results.

### Phosphorus
As kidney function declines, extra phosphorus can build up, weakening bones. Managing your intake of phosphorus-rich foods is crucial for bone and heart health.

### Potassium
Potassium is vital for muscle and heart function. In advanced CKD, too much can be dangerous. Your needs will depend on your kidney function and medications.

### Protein
Protein is essential for muscle and tissue repair. Eating the right amount—not too much, not too little—is key. Plant-based proteins are often easier on the kidneys.

### Sodium
Limiting sodium is crucial to manage blood pressure and prevent fluid buildup. Focus on fresh foods and flavor with herbs and spices instead of salt.

## Other Important Considerations
### Calcium
Foods high in calcium are often also high in phosphorus. Your doctor will guide you on whether to limit calcium. Always consult them before taking any over-the-counter calcium or vitamin D supplements.

### Fluids
In early-stage CKD, fluid restriction is usually not needed. As the disease progresses, your doctor may advise you to limit your fluid intake to prevent swelling and heart strain.

### Calories
Getting the right number of calories provides the energy your body needs and helps it use protein effectively. A dietitian can help you create a plan to maintain a healthy weight.

### Vitamins and Minerals
People with CKD may need special vitamin or mineral supplements because some foods are restricted. Only take supplements prescribed by your doctor, as many over-the-counter products can be harmful.
