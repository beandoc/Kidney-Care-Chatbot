# Vaccinations for People with Kidney Disease

## Why are vaccines important for people with kidney disease?

People with chronic kidney disease (CKD), especially those with kidney failure (ESRD) or who have had a kidney transplant, have a weakened immune system. This makes it harder for them to fight off infections. Infections can be very serious in people with kidney disease and can lead to hospitalization or other complications. Vaccines are a safe and effective way to protect yourself from many common and serious diseases.

It is very important to stay up-to-date on your vaccinations. Your nephrologist (kidney doctor) can tell you which vaccines you need and when you should get them.

## Recommended Vaccines for Kidney Patients

Here are some of the vaccines that are commonly recommended for people with kidney disease:

### 1. Influenza (Flu) Vaccine
-   **Who needs it:** Everyone with kidney disease should get a flu shot every year.
-   **Why:** The flu can be very serious, leading to pneumonia and other severe complications, especially in people with chronic health conditions.
-   **When:** Get it annually, usually in the fall before the flu season starts.

### 2. Pneumococcal (Pneumonia) Vaccine
-   **Who needs it:** All adults with CKD should be vaccinated against pneumococcal disease.
-   **Why:** This vaccine protects against serious infections like pneumonia, meningitis, and bloodstream infections caused by the *Streptococcus pneumoniae* bacteria.
-   **Details:** There are two types of pneumococcal vaccines (PCV13/PCV15 and PPSV23). Your doctor will recommend the right schedule for you.

### 3. Hepatitis B Vaccine
-   **Who needs it:** This vaccine is especially crucial for people on hemodialysis. It is recommended for most patients with CKD.
-   **Why:** Patients on hemodialysis are at a higher risk of getting Hepatitis B because the treatment involves frequent access to your blood. Hepatitis B is a serious liver infection.
-   **Details:** It is usually given as a series of 3 or 4 shots. Your dialysis center may require you to get this vaccine.

### 4. COVID-19 Vaccine
-   **Who needs it:** Everyone, especially those with CKD and transplant recipients.
-   **Why:** People with kidney disease are at a very high risk of becoming severely ill if they get COVID-19. The vaccines are highly effective at preventing severe illness, hospitalization, and death.
-   **Details:** It is important to get the primary series and stay up-to-date with recommended boosters.

### 5. Tdap (Tetanus, Diphtheria, and Pertussis) Vaccine
-   **Who needs it:** Follows the standard recommendations for all adults.
-   **Why:** Protects against tetanus (lockjaw), diphtheria, and pertussis (whooping cough). A Tdap booster is recommended every 10 years.

## Always Talk to Your Doctor
This information is a general guide. Your specific vaccination needs may be different based on your age, stage of kidney disease, transplant status, and vaccination history. Always talk to your nephrologist or healthcare provider to create a vaccination plan that is right for you. They can ensure you get the protection you need safely.
