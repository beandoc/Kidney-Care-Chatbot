# How Your Kidneys Work
Your kidneys are a critical part of your health. They "clean" your blood by removing waste through urine, help make red blood cells, and regulate blood pressure.

## The Body's Master Chemists
One of the main jobs of the kidneys is to filter wastes from the blood and return cleaned blood back to the body. Every minute, about a liter of blood—one-fifth of all the blood pumped by the heart—enters the kidneys.

Amazingly, a single healthy kidney can greatly increase its workload. If one kidney is injured or donated, the remaining one can work harder to keep your body healthy.

## Inside the Kidney: The Nephrons
Inside each kidney are over a million tiny filtering units called nephrons. Each nephron contains a microscopic filter called a glomerulus, which is attached to a tubule. As blood passes through, the glomeruli separate water and waste products, which then flow into the tubules.

Much of this water is reabsorbed by the tubules, while the wastes are concentrated into urine. The urine collects in the renal pelvis and flows through tubes called ureters to the bladder, ready to be passed out of the body. On average, the kidneys produce one to two liters of urine daily.

## Why Are Kidneys So Important?
### Regulate Water
For your body to work correctly, it needs just the right amount of water. The kidneys masterfully remove excess water or retain it when the body needs more, maintaining perfect balance.

### Remove Waste & Balance Minerals
The body needs minerals like sodium and potassium from food, but they must be kept at precise levels. Healthy kidneys filter out any excess. They also manage calcium and phosphate, which are vital for bone strength. Wastes like urea and creatinine are also removed; rising levels of these in the blood are a key indicator of decreased kidney function.

### Produce Hormones
Normal kidneys are also hormone factories. They produce essential chemical messengers that circulate in the bloodstream to regulate blood pressure, stimulate red blood cell production, and maintain the body's calcium balance.
