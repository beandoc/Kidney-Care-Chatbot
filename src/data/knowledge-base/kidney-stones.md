# Kidney Stones

## What is a Kidney Stone?
A kidney stone is a hard, solid object formed from chemicals in the urine. Normally, urine contains dissolved waste products. When there's too much waste in too little liquid, crystals can form. These crystals attract other elements, growing into a solid mass unless passed from the body. While the kidneys are master chemists at eliminating these substances, sometimes they build up. A stone can remain in the kidney or travel down the urinary tract. Small stones might pass with minimal pain, but larger ones can block urine flow, causing significant discomfort.

## Symptoms of Kidney Stones
Kidney stones vary in size from a grain of sand to a golf ball. The larger the stone, the more severe the symptoms are likely to be. Pain occurs when the stone causes irritation or blockage. Common signs include:

*   Severe pain on either side of your lower back, or a persistent stomach ache.
*   Blood in the urine (hematuria).
*   Nausea or vomiting.
*   Fever and chills.
*   Cloudy or foul-smelling urine.

Most stones pass without long-term damage, though often with intense pain. While pain relievers may be sufficient for small stones, larger or more complicated stones might require medical intervention or surgery.

## Common Causes
Key causes include inadequate water intake, exercise habits (too much or too little), obesity, and diets high in salt or sugar. Infections and family history can also play a role. High consumption of fructose, found in table sugar and high-fructose corn syrup, is linked to an increased risk.

## Four Main Types
*   **Calcium Oxalate:** The most common type, formed when calcium combines with oxalate in the urine.
*   **Uric Acid:** Often linked to high-purine diets (organ meats, shellfish) and can be hereditary.
*   **Struvite:** Less common and typically caused by upper urinary tract infections.
*   **Cystine:** A rare type that tends to run in families.

## Prevention Strategies
If you've had one kidney stone, your risk of developing another is about 50% within 5-7 years. Prevention is key. Hereâ€™s how you can reduce your risk:

### Stay Hydrated
Drink plenty of fluids, primarily water, to keep your urine light yellow or clear. This helps dilute the waste products that form stones. Water is preferable to sodas, sports drinks, or coffee.

### Adjust Your Diet
Eat more fruits and vegetables to make your urine less acidic. Limit animal protein, which increases acidity. Reduce salt intake by avoiding processed foods like sandwich meats, canned soups, and packaged meals.

### Maintain a Healthy Weight
If you are overweight, aim for a healthy weight through a balanced diet. Avoid high-protein or crash diets, as they can increase stone risk.

### Consult a Professional
If you've had a stone or are at risk, see a doctor or a registered dietitian. They can analyze your specific situation and recommend personalized dietary changes.
