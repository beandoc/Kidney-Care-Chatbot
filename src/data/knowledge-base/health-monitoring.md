# Measuring Your Health

## Measuring Your General Health

### Blood Pressure
High blood pressure is a leading cause of kidney disease. Monitoring your blood pressure and keeping it within a healthy range is crucial for protecting your kidneys.

### Weight
A healthy weight, which depends on your height, age, and health, is important. Unexplained weight loss could signal nutritional issues, while gradual gain might relate to diet or activity. For those on dialysis or with heart failure, sudden weight gain can indicate fluid retention and should be reported to your doctor. Your "dry weight" (normal weight without extra fluid) is a key number to monitor daily.

## Measuring Your Kidney Health

### Serum (Blood) Creatinine
Creatinine is a waste product from muscle activity. When kidneys are not working well, creatinine levels in the blood rise. This test is a key indicator of kidney function.

### Cystatin C
This is another protein that can be measured in the blood to estimate kidney function. It can sometimes be more accurate than creatinine because it is less affected by muscle mass, age, or diet.

### Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR)
This is the most common way to assess kidney function. It's a calculation based on your blood creatinine (or cystatin C) level, age, and sex. It estimates how well your kidneys are filtering your blood.

### Measured Glomerular Filtration Rate (mGFR)
In specific cases where a highly precise measurement is needed, your doctor may order an mGFR. This is a direct measurement of your kidney's filtering capacity. It is more complex than an eGFR, often involving a 24-hour urine collection or multiple blood draws over several hours.

### Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)
BUN measures the amount of urea nitrogen, a waste product of protein breakdown, in your blood. High BUN levels can be a sign of kidney problems, but can also be caused by dehydration or a high-protein diet.

### Urine Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (uACR)
This urine test checks for albumin, a type of protein. Healthy kidneys don't let much albumin pass into the urine. A high uACR is an early sign of kidney damage.

### Urine Protein-to-Creatinine Ratio (uPCR)
Similar to uACR, this test measures the total amount of protein in your urine. It is another important marker for kidney damage.

## Balance of Minerals & Acidity

### Potassium
Potassium is an important mineral that helps your nerves and muscles work. Damaged kidneys can have trouble removing potassium, leading to dangerously high levels in the blood.

### Sodium
Sodium helps balance fluids in your body. Kidneys regulate sodium levels. With kidney disease, you may need to limit sodium intake to manage blood pressure and fluid retention.

### Serum Bicarbonate / Carbon Dioxide (CO2)
This test measures the amount of acid in your blood. Kidneys help maintain the body's acid-base balance. When they fail, the blood can become too acidic (a condition called metabolic acidosis).

## Monitoring for CKD Complications

### Nutrition & Malnourishment
People with CKD can lose their appetite or have dietary restrictions that lead to poor nutrition. Regular monitoring helps prevent malnourishment.

### Anemia (Low Red Blood Cells)
Healthy kidneys produce a hormone that tells your body to make red blood cells. When kidneys are damaged, they may not make enough of this hormone, leading to anemia, which causes fatigue.

### Mineral and Bone Disorder (CKD-MBD)
This is a common complication where the balance of calcium and phosphorus in the blood is disrupted, leading to weak bones and potential damage to blood vessels.

### Cardiovascular Disease (CVD)
Kidney disease significantly increases the risk of heart disease and stroke. Monitoring for cardiovascular health is a critical part of CKD management.

## Monitoring for CKD Risk Factors

### Diabetes
Controlling blood sugar is essential for people with diabetes to prevent or slow down kidney disease. The A1C test is a key measure of long-term blood sugar control.

## Questions for Your Healthcare Team
Use these questions to start a conversation with your doctor or dietitian:

* Am I at a healthy weight?
* What is my recommended goal for blood pressure?
* What are my goal A1C and/or blood glucose levels?
* What is my "dry weight," and when should I be concerned about changes?
* Are there any test results you are particularly concerned about?
* Do any of my results have a different goal range than what's listed on the lab report?
