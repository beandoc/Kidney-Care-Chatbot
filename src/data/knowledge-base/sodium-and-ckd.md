# Sodium and Your CKD Diet
Learn how to limit sodium in your diet to manage blood pressure and fluid balance. Flavoring food with herbs and spices instead of salt is a key strategy for kidney health.

## Why Limiting Sodium Is Crucial
Healthy kidneys control the amount of sodium in your body. When kidney function declines, excess sodium and fluid can build up, leading to serious issues like swollen ankles (edema), high blood pressure, shortness of breath, and dangerous fluid around your heart and lungs. By using less sodium, you can help manage these problems.

A healthy diet should include no more than 2,300 mg of sodium per day, but your doctor may recommend less.

## Reducing Sodium: Food Swaps
Making smart choices can significantly lower your sodium intake. Here are some common high-sodium foods and better alternatives.
| High-Sodium Foods to Limit | Low-Sodium Alternatives |
| :--- | :--- |
| Table salt, seasoning salts (garlic, onion salt), meat tenderizer, soy sauce, steak sauce. | Fresh garlic/onion, garlic/onion powder, black pepper, lemon juice, vinegar, salt-free seasoning blends. |
| Salted snacks (chips, pretzels, nuts), pickles, olives, sauerkraut. | Unsalted crackers, popcorn, pretzels, nuts; fresh vegetables like cucumbers. |
| Cured meats (ham, bacon, salt pork), luncheon meats (hot dogs, cold cuts, sausage), spam. | Fresh beef, veal, pork, poultry, fish, eggs. Look for low-salt deli meats if available. |
| Most canned soups, vegetables, and tomato products; processed cheese; frozen TV dinners, packaged mixes (e.g., mac & cheese), and fast food. | Homemade or low-sodium soups; fresh or frozen vegetables; no-salt-added canned goods; natural cheeses in moderation. |

## Tips for Reading Food Labels
Reading labels is a key skill for managing sodium. Look at the milligrams (mg) of sodium per serving.

*   **Serving Size:** All nutrition values are based on this amount. If you eat more, you get more sodium.
*   **General Rule:** If an item has more milligrams of sodium than calories per serving, it's likely too high.
*   **Check Ingredients:** If salt is one of the first five ingredients, the food is probably high in sodium.
*   **Understanding Terms:**
    *   **Sodium-Free:** Less than 5mg per serving.
    *   **Low Sodium:** 140mg or less per serving.
    *   **Reduced Sodium:** At least 25% less sodium than the regular version.

## Spice Up Your Cooking Without Salt
Giving up salt doesnâ€™t mean giving up flavor. Experiment with herbs and spices to create new and exciting tastes.

*   **Allspice:** Great with beef, fish, beets, cabbage, and carrots.
*   **Basil:** Pairs well with beef, pork, and most vegetables.
*   **Caraway:** Use with beef, pork, green beans, and cauliflower.
*   **Curry:** Excellent for beef, chicken, pork, and fish.
*   **Dill:** Perfect for beef, chicken, green beans, and carrots.
*   **Ginger:** Adds a kick to beef, chicken, and pork dishes.
*   **Rosemary:** Complements chicken, pork, and cauliflower.
*   **Thyme:** A classic for beef, chicken, fish, and green beans.

## A Word of Caution on Salt Substitutes
Be very careful with salt substitutes! Most use potassium chloride to mimic the taste of salt. If you've been told to limit potassium, these products can be dangerous. Always check with your doctor or dietitian before using any salt substitute.
