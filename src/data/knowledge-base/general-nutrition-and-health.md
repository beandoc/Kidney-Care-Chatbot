# Good Nutrition for Better Health
Good nutrition is fundamental to your physical and mental well-being. A balanced diet provides the energy and nutrients your body needs to function at its best.

## What Are Nutrients?
Nutrients are essential components in food that your body uses to grow, repair tissues, and build new muscle. No single food provides all the nutrients you need. A healthy diet requires combining foods from various food groups to meet your body's daily requirements.

## How to Eat a Healthy Diet
Following a balanced eating plan is the cornerstone of good health. Here are some simple guidelines:

* Eat a Variety: Consume a wide range of foods from all food groups to ensure you get a broad spectrum of nutrients.
* Limit Unhealthy Fats and Sugar: Opt for foods that are low in saturated fats, trans fats, and added sugars.
* Reduce Salt Intake: Choose and prepare foods with low sodium content to support heart and kidney health.
* Read Food Labels: Understanding nutrition labels helps you make informed choices about what you eat.

Smart Shopping: Understanding Food Labels
The Nutrition Facts label on packaged foods is a powerful tool. By law, it provides key information to help you make healthier choices. The label shows:

* Serving Size: The amount of food the nutrition information is based on.
* Calories and Fat: The total calories per serving and how many of those come from fat.
* Vitamins and Minerals: A list of important nutrients the food provides.

## Vitamins, Minerals, and Supplements
### Do I need a vitamin and mineral supplement?
A well-balanced diet typically provides all the vitamins and minerals your body needs. Supplements may be necessary if your diet lacks variety, but you should always consult your doctor before starting any new supplement.

### Are herbal supplements safe?
Not always. Herbal supplements are not regulated by the FDA, so their purity, safety, and effectiveness are not guaranteed. They can cause allergic reactions or interfere with prescribed medications. Always check with your doctor or dietitian before taking any herbal product.

## The Importance of Physical Activity
When combined with a healthy diet, regular physical activity is a cornerstone of overall health. Aim for 150-300 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week, which can be broken into smaller, 10-minute sessions. Regular exercise helps:

* Maintain a healthy weight and lose excess weight.
* Prevent chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, and CKD.
* Prevent high cholesterol.
* Build strength, endurance, and cope with stress.
