# Potassium and Your Diet
Potassium is a crucial mineral for nerve and muscle function, especially your heart. In CKD, keeping potassium levels in a safe range is essential.

## Managing Potassium Levels
People with kidney disease are at risk for potassium levels that are too high (hyperkalemia) or too low (hypokalemia). Your doctor will advise you whether you need to limit or increase potassium in your diet based on your lab results. Almost all foods contain potassium, but portion size is keyâ€”a large amount of a low-potassium food can become a high-potassium meal.

## High- and Low-Potassium Food Choices
A "high-potassium" food has over 200mg per serving. Work with your dietitian to create a balanced plan.
| Food Category | Higher in Potassium (Limit) | Lower in Potassium (Choose More Often) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fruits** | Apricots, avocado, banana, cantaloupe, dried fruits, kiwi, mango, oranges, papaya, pomegranate, prunes. | Apples, berries, cherries, cranberries, grapes, grapefruit, peaches, pears, pineapple, plums, watermelon. |
| **Vegetables** | Acorn & butternut squash, artichoke, beans (dried), beets, cooked broccoli, potatoes, cooked spinach, tomatoes. | Asparagus, green beans, raw broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, corn, cucumber, eggplant, lettuce, onions, peppers. |
| **Other Foods** | Beef, chicken, chocolate, milk, nuts, peanut butter, salmon, yogurt, salt substitutes. | Bread (not whole grain), cake, coffee/tea (in moderation), noodles, pasta, rice. |

## Tips to Lower Potassium in Your Food
### Leaching Vegetables
Leaching is a process that can pull some (but not all) potassium out of high-potassium vegetables, allowing you to eat them in moderation. Ask your dietitian if this is a good strategy for you.

1.  Peel and slice the vegetable into 1/8-inch thick pieces.
2.  Rinse with warm water.
3.  Soak for at least 2 hours in warm, unsalted water (use 10 parts water to 1 part vegetable).
4.  Rinse again.
5.  Cook the vegetable in fresh, unsalted water (use 5 parts water to 1 part vegetable).

### Another Easy Tip
Avoid drinking or using the liquid from canned fruits and vegetables, as well as the juices from cooked meat, as potassium leaches into these liquids.
