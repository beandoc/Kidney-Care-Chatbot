This is a placeholder file for the knowledge base.
You can add your own .txt files in this directory ('src/data/knowledge-base').
The chatbot will read these files to answer user questions.
For example, you can add files with information about kidney health, diet, treatments, etc.
Remove this file once you have added your own data.
