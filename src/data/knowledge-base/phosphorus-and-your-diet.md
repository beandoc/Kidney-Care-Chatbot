# Phosphorus and Your Diet
Phosphorus is a mineral essential for building strong bones and keeping your body healthy. When you have CKD, managing phosphorus is key to protecting your bones and heart.

## Why Phosphorus Matters in CKD
Healthy kidneys filter extra phosphorus from your blood. In CKD, this filtering ability is reduced, leading to high phosphorus levels. This imbalance can pull calcium from your bones, making them weak and brittle. It also causes dangerous calcium deposits in blood vessels, lungs, eyes, and the heart, increasing the risk of heart attack, stroke, or death. A normal phosphorus level is 2.5 to 4.5 mg/dL.

## How to Control Your Phosphorus Level
You can manage phosphorus through diet, dialysis, and medications. Dialysis removes some phosphorus, but limiting it between treatments is crucial.

### Organic vs. Inorganic Phosphorus
*   **Organic Phosphorus:** Naturally found in protein-rich foods like meats, poultry, fish, nuts, beans, and dairy. Phosphorus from animal sources is more easily absorbed than from plant sources.
*   **Inorganic Phosphorus (Additives):** Added to processed foods like fast food, deli meats, and bottled drinks. This type is almost completely absorbed by the body. Avoid foods with "PHOS" in the ingredients list.

### Choosing Low-Phosphorus Foods
Your dietitian can help you make smart swaps. Here are some examples:

| Food Category | High Phosphorus (Limit or Avoid) | Lower Phosphorus (Enjoy) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Beverages** | Beer, dark colas, canned iced teas, drinks with milk or phosphate additives. | Water, coffee, tea, clear sodas (ginger ale, lemon-lime), most fruit juices. |
| **Dairy** | Cheese, milk, ice cream, pudding, most yogurts. | Rice milk, almond milk, cottage cheese, vegan cheese, sherbet, popsicles. |
| **Protein** | Organ meats (liver), sardines, deli meats, bacon, sausage, hot dogs. | Chicken, turkey, fish, beef, veal, eggs, lamb, pork. |
| **Other** | Chocolate, caramel, pizza, most processed foods, oat bran. | Fruits, vegetables, rice cakes, unsalted pretzels/popcorn, sugar cookies. |

### Phosphate Binders
Your doctor may prescribe phosphate binders, which are medications you take with meals and snacks. These binders act like sponges, soaking up phosphorus from your food in your gut so it doesn't get absorbed into your blood. It's crucial to take them as directed to effectively control your phosphorus levels.
