# Kidney Transplant

When kidneys fail, treatment is required to take over their functions. The two primary treatments are dialysis and kidney transplant. A transplant provides you with a healthy kidney to perform the tasks your own kidneys can no longer handle. On average, a kidney from a living donor functions for 15-20 years, while one from a deceased donor lasts 8-12 years, though individual results vary.

While many patients begin dialysis before receiving a transplant, it's also possible to get a preemptive transplant before dialysis is needed. Research suggests that a preemptive transplant, with little to no time on dialysis, can lead to better long-term health outcomes and a higher quality of life. If you are in Stage 3B, 4, or 5 of CKD, it's an ideal time to discuss transplant options with your doctor.

## Types: Living and Deceased Donors

There are two sources for a donor kidney:

-   **Deceased Donor:** The kidney comes from an individual who has passed away and chose to be an organ donor.
-   **Living Donor:** The kidney is donated by a living person with two healthy kidneys. A living donor can be a family member, friend, or even a stranger, and does not need to be related to you.

The first step for either type of transplant is a thorough evaluation at a transplant center. A potential living donor can often be evaluated at the same time as the recipient (the person receiving the kidney).

## Benefits of a Transplant

-   Studies indicate that individuals with kidney transplants generally live longer than those who remain on dialysis.
-   A successful transplant can restore the freedom to work, travel, and spend more time with loved ones, improving your overall quality of life.
-   Dietary restrictions are often less strict, though a heart-healthy diet is recommended to protect your new kidney.
-   Most patients experience improved health and energy levels.

## Risks of a Transplant

-   A transplant is a treatment, not a cure for kidney disease.
-   You must take anti-rejection medications (immunosuppressants) daily for as long as the kidney works. These can have side effects.
-   There is an increased risk for infections and certain types of cancer due to the immunosuppressant medications.
-   The lifespan of a transplanted kidney varies, and some individuals may need more than one transplant in their lifetime.

## Who Can Get a Transplant?

Kidney patients of all ages can be considered for a transplant. While some centers may have age limits, many do not. Every potential candidate undergoes a comprehensive medical and psychosocial evaluation to ensure they are healthy enough for surgery and prepared for post-transplant care. Even with other health conditions like diabetes, a successful transplant is often possible. It is important to note that being placed on the waitlist is not automatic; you must be evaluated at a transplant center first.

## The Transplant Surgery

The surgery to place the new kidney typically lasts 3-4 hours. The donated kidney is positioned in the lower abdomen to easily connect it to your blood vessels and bladder. Your own kidneys are usually left in place unless there's a specific medical reason to remove them.

Recovery begins quickly. You will be encouraged to stand and walk soon after the surgery. Most patients can return home within a few days, followed by frequent check-ups at the transplant center. Over time, as you and your new kidney stabilize, your regular kidney doctor will resume your care.

## Where to Start

### Your First Step: Evaluation

The journey to a transplant begins with an evaluation at a transplant center. You can ask your doctor for a referral or contact a center directlyâ€”a practice known as a self-referral. This evaluation is necessary even if you already have a willing living donor.
