# Kidney Transplant

## What is a Kidney Transplant?

A kidney transplant is a surgery to place a healthy kidney from a living or deceased donor into a person whose kidneys no longer function properly. A kidney transplant is a treatment for kidney failure (end-stage renal disease), not a cure. The new kidney does the work that your two failed kidneys used to do.

## Who Can Get a Kidney Transplant?

A transplant is an option for people with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The transplant team will perform a full medical and psychosocial evaluation to determine if you are a good candidate. You must be healthy enough for surgery and be able to stick to the required treatment plan after the transplant. A transplant may not be recommended if you have an active infection, a recent history of cancer, or severe heart or lung disease.

## Where Do Donated Kidneys Come From?

There are two sources for a donor kidney:

1.  **Living Donor:** A living donor is a healthy person who chooses to donate one of their kidneys. This can be a family member (like a parent, sibling, or child), a spouse, a friend, or even a stranger (an altruistic donor). Kidneys from living donors generally last longer and start working faster.
2.  **Deceased Donor:** A deceased donor is someone who has been declared brain dead and whose family has consented to organ donation. Most kidney transplants come from deceased donors. Patients waiting for a deceased donor kidney are placed on a national waiting list.

## The Transplant Surgery

The transplant surgery typically takes about 3 to 4 hours. The surgeon places the new kidney in your lower abdomen and connects the artery and vein of the new kidney to your artery and vein. Your own kidneys are usually left in place unless they are causing problems like high blood pressure or infection. The new kidney's ureter (the tube that carries urine) is connected to your bladder. Most people start to make urine as soon as the blood starts flowing through the new kidney.

## Life After Transplant

After a successful kidney transplant, you can expect a significant improvement in your quality of life. You will feel more energetic and will have fewer dietary restrictions than you did on dialysis.

However, a transplant is a lifelong commitment. You will need to take special medications called immunosuppressants (anti-rejection drugs) every day for as long as you have your new kidney. These drugs prevent your body's immune system from attacking and rejecting the new kidney. These medications have side effects, and you will need regular check-ups with your transplant team to monitor your health and kidney function closely.
