# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Deploying to Vercel

This application is fully compatible with Vercel. To deploy it, you can follow these steps:

1.  **Fork this repository** to your own GitHub account.
2.  **Create a new project on Vercel** and import the forked repository.
3.  **Configure Environment Variables:** In the Vercel project settings, you will need to add an environment variable for the Gemini API key.
    -   **Name:** `GEMINI_API_KEY`
    -   **Value:** Your actual Gemini API Key from Google AI Studio.

Vercel will automatically detect that this is a Next.js project and deploy it for you.
