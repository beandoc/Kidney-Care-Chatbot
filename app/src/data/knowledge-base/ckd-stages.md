# The 5 Stages of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)

Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is divided into five stages based on the estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR), which is a measure of how well your kidneys are filtering waste from your blood. Understanding your stage helps your doctor create the best treatment plan for you.

## Stage 1: eGFR 90 or higher
- **Meaning:** Kidney damage is present, but kidney function is still normal or high.
- **Symptoms:** Usually, there are no symptoms. The condition might be discovered through tests for another condition, such as protein in the urine (albuminuria).
- **Goal:** Slow the progression of the disease and manage underlying conditions like high blood pressure and diabetes. This includes a healthy diet, regular exercise, and not smoking.

## Stage 2: eGFR between 60 and 89
- **Meaning:** Mild decrease in kidney function.
- **Symptoms:** Like stage 1, there are often no symptoms.
- **Goal:** The focus remains on protecting the kidneys and managing health conditions to prevent further damage. Regular check-ups with your doctor are crucial.

## Stage 3: eGFR between 30 and 59
This stage is often divided into two sub-stages:
- **Stage 3a:** eGFR between 45 and 59 (Mild to moderate loss of kidney function)
- **Stage 3b:** eGFR between 30 and 44 (Moderate to severe loss of kidney function)
- **Symptoms:** Some people may start to notice symptoms like swelling in their hands and feet, fatigue, or changes in urination. Complications like high blood pressure, anemia (low red blood cell count), and early bone disease can develop.
- **Goal:** Treat complications and continue to slow the progression of the disease. Your doctor may refer you to a nephrologist (kidney specialist) and a dietitian.

## Stage 4: eGFR between 15 and 29
- **Meaning:** Severe decrease in kidney function.
- **Symptoms:** Symptoms are more likely at this stage and can include fatigue, swelling, nausea, and loss of appetite. Complications like anemia and bone disease are common.
- **Goal:** This is the last stage before kidney failure. It is critical to prepare for potential treatments like dialysis or a kidney transplant. Your healthcare team will discuss these options with you in detail.

## Stage 5: eGFR less than 15
- **Meaning:** Kidney failure. The kidneys have lost nearly all their ability to function effectively.
- **Symptoms:** Significant symptoms of waste buildup in the body, such as severe fatigue, nausea and vomiting, itching, and shortness of breath.
- **Goal:** The patient will need to start dialysis or receive a kidney transplant to survive. This stage is also known as End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD).
